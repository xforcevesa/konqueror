# Konqueror Core

A CPU core and several miscellaneous components based on the Chisel HDL.

Also, I'm re-doing experiments in [this link](https://gitee.com/loongson-edu/cdp_ede_local) with the Chisel HDL. The contents can be seen on [`src/main/scala/experiments`](./src/main/scala/experiments/) and [`src/test/scala/experiments`](./src/test/scala/experiments/), in which the former contains the experiments and the latter contains the test cases that can verify the correctness of the design automatically and be triggered by the CI on GitHub Actions, which is a good practice for collaborative development.

The [original README](./TEMPLATE.md) is generated from the Chisel project template, from which the code is derived. You can find more information on it, such as methods that helps you to build this project.

More contents will be added here later.
